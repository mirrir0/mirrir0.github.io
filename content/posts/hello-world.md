# Hello World

Welcome to my terminal-style blog. This is a markdown-powered blog built with React Router v7 and server-side rendering.

## Features

- **Markdown parsing** with frontmatter support
- **Dark theme** inspired by terminal documentation
- **Server-side rendering** for fast initial loads
- **Left-justified layout** for easy reading

## Code Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

## What's Next

This blog will cover topics like:

1. Systems programming
2. Web development
3. DevOps and infrastructure
4. Open source projects
